== HOW DO I INSERT CALENDARIZE IT IN A PAGE OR POST? ==

You can insert Calendars in any Page, Post or Custom Post Type you want.
Use the following Shortcodes to insert Calendars:

[calendarizeit]
This Shortcode will insert the Calendar and will display all events created by all users.

[calendarizeit author_name='username']
This Shortcode will insert the Calendar and only display events created by the 'username'. Replace 'username' with any user from WordPress

[calendarizeit author='ID,ID']
This Shortcode will insert the Calendar and display events created by multiple authors. Replace ID with the ID number of the author. You can find the ID number of an author by holding the cursor over "edit" in the Users List, and then view the bottom line. It will show something like /user-edit.php?user_id=2. In this case enter the number "2" as the ID.

[calendarizeit post_type="post"]
This Shortcode will insert the Calendar and display the post type that you enter. You will need to enable the Custom Post Type in the options panel.

[calendarizeit taxonomy='calendar' terms='concerts']
This Shortcode will insert the Calendar and based on the Custom Taxonomy that you have defined you can display e.g. a Concert Calendar. 

[calendarizeit venue='place']
This Shortcode will insert the Calendar and based on the 'place' (venue) it will display all events assigned to the specific venue.

[calendarizeit organizer='name']
This Shortcode will insert the Calendar and based on the 'name' (organizer) it will display all events assigned to the specific organizer.

[calendarizeit calendar='name']
This Shortcode will insert the Calendar and based on the 'name' (calendar) it will display all events assigned to the specific calendar.


== SOURCES - CREDITS & LICENSES ==

We have used the following open source projects, graphics, fonts, API's or other files as listed. Thanks to the author for the creative work they made.

1) FullCalendar jQuery plugin
   http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/

DISCLAIMER: FullCalendar is great for displaying events, but it isn't a complete solution for event content-management. Beyond dragging an event to a different time/day, you cannot change an event's name or other associated data. It is up to you to add this functionality through FullCalendar's event hooks.

2) jQuery UI ThemeRoller
